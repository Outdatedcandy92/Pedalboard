## What am I making?
I'm making cheap DIY analog guitar effect pedals for Distortion and Fuzz. To ensure a high quality pedal I will be using reverse engineered schematic of the iconic Boss DS-1 and the Big Muff Pi. Careful planning will be done to ensure that these DIY pedals perform equally as well only for a fraction of the price, while still keeping in mind the Mod-ability and ease of repair.
## Time Spent Overall: 53 Hours

### My Goals For This Project-
- [ ] Only THT Components
- [ ] Easy to modify
- [ ] Cheap components

# Day 1 (17th May) - Started DS-1 

Since I already made a DS-1 pedal before I had experience with designing pedals and I also knew about stuff I should avoid adding in my design.
Some of those problems were -
- Having thin holes for the potentiometers
- Placing the potentiometer holes in the middle instead of at the edges
- Using holes to solder wire instead of having screw in terminals

To start with the project I made the DS-1 v2 schematics in kicad, the schematics for version 2 were similar to version one because the schematics just work!

I started out with PCB layout after finishing It. I always like to first start of with a rough layout to see how I can arrange my components and look at how I can improve from their and then restart the PCB layout again. 
This is exactly what I did for this design and by the end of the day I ended up with a layout that I liked.

The next step was routing everything together. Because I already made something like this I had experience and knew what to avoid while tracing. 
I carefully routed all the audio signals first, keeping the traces short and smooth. After that I routed my power traces, this time I made sure that the power traces were far away from the audio signal and that they also cross the audio traces are a 90 degree angle to reduce EMI and noise from the power trace radiating into the audio traces. This was a lesson I learned from making version 1, my power traces were routed improperly which introduced a 60hz hum from the cheap power supply into the audio signal, It worked fine but there was just a buzz which was a bit annoying.

This was the final result PCB design:

## Time Spent: 5 Hours

I was pretty locked in today!

# Day 2 (19th May) - Big Muff Schematic

I started working on designing the big muff pi schematic today. 

The big muff pi is pretty easy to make compared to a DS-1, and I finished making its schematics in like 30 mins.

After that I started working on the PCB for it. I again followed the same method I listed above of creating a rough layout then going to a finalized one. And this was the end result of the PCB.

# Day 3 (5th June) - Updated DS-1 PCB

tl;dr I was pretty ambitious when starting this project but I have now decided to split this into three different projects.

After pondering and doing some research I've decided to actually split this project. Right now Im making a lot of pedals and Initially I though all of them could be made using analog circuitry, but I was wrong, for a lot of these effects I listed initially (chorus, eq, loop, noise gate) having a digital pedal is the only viable option. And so I have decided I'm going to split this into three different projects- one of which is this project (Distortion, Fuzz , the second project would be making a digital pedal that's capable of the effects listed above and is expandable, lastly the third project would be create a pedalboard for these pedals and a dedicated low noise power supply. Creating a digital pedal is way more complicated that I initially expected it to be and that's why I'm gonna keep it as its own separate project. 



Now back to the actual project. Today I did some minor revisions over the DS-1 PCB layout, I added ground pours on both top and bottom layers and stitched them together with a lot of vias. This will help keep ground plane continuity throughout the board and reduce EMI which in turn will reduce any buzzing/hiss generated by a noisy power supply (hopefully).

I also realized just now that I placed in the screw in terminal footprints in the wrong orientation. 


I updated the footprints and fixed the problem.

# Day 4 (6th June) - Big Muff PCB

Today I started working on routing the Big Muff Pi, It was a pretty long and boring process but here is the final result

![img](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/1abad4393a3eabd854601cc3e34a848323cbad31_image.png)

I'm not super happy with the way it came out for a few reasons-
- The power traces are long and cross through a lot of audio signals, while the traces cant be made any shorter I could route them in a much more efficient way.
- Very dense layout led to a lot of audio traces to be routed from on the bottom layer, while this is not that big of a deal I would prefer if most of the audio traces were on the top layer and only power traces were on the bottom


I also started working on making a BOM for this project today, I spent a lot of time just surfing on aliexpress for cheap component kits which include everything I require for this project. This took a few hours because I had to cross check the component values from the aliexpress listings to the component values required. Overall I finished about 60% of the BOM today.


## Time Spent: 5 Hours 

# Day 5 (June 7th) - Redid Everything

I finished making the BOM today and the overall cost comes up to about $90 USD which is a bit expensive but not bad considering that this is the cost for two pedals which would be something $180 USD if buying the originals. Also with all the parts in the BOM you could make about at least 4 of these pedals, the only thing bringing up the cost in our DIY scenario is the 125B Aluminium Enclosure. I think spending money on a Aluminium enclosure is 100% worth it, I've tried using a plastic case for my DS-1 version 1 and wrapping it with aluminium foil but it just doesn't shield it from EMI properly and is a big hassle overall, Its much better to get a solid enclosure which can handle the stomping and shield the internal circuitry from EMI.


I also decided to reroute the whole Big Muff PCB again and here are the results-

Even though the Big Muff's schematics were easier compared to DS-1, routing the Big Muff was way way harder. This was a very dense layout and very complicated to route but nevertheless I finished routing It.

---

Well on second though I decided to completely scrape my PCB design and start a new one from scratch. There were far too many problems with the routing on version 1 of the Big Muff, there were a lot of traces overlapping and long power traces parallel to audio traces.
I decided to increase the board size a bit and have two separate screw in terminals for the guitar input and output. This was the layout I finally decided on-


![img](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/567903da78c23ae1ac594554e24a8dccc07a1c3c_image.png)

In my humble opinion I would like to say that I absolutely cooked while making this. Its just so beautiful and organized, and much much better than the previous layout.

--- 

I also create a basic CAD design for the case, I'm gonna be using a 125B Aluminium enclosure so there was not much to design, I just had to place the components to get a rough idea of where to drill the holes later on. Anyways here is the case -

![img](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/cfc9453dcd8d3666d0fb4c247b695b5bdb508f5a_125b_enclosure_2025-jun-07_12-51-06am-000_customizedview11464864200.png)

I'm still unsure if I should add some spray paint in my BOM and make my pedal colorful instead of just a grey box.

---

I also decided I should try panelizing the PCBs and order both PCB as one board to save cost and get more boards, but in order to do that I had to reduce the size of the DS-1 PCB down a few mm. So I decided to start off fresh for the DS-1 PCB and this time set the board size to 45x45mm. I spent a few hours creating a new layout and ended up with this -

After about a hour or so of routing I ended up with this masterpiece-

I also have like 22 DRC errors about edge clearance violations and courtyard overlaps but I'm gonna pretend like I didn't see that.

---

I panelized my design now I can now get 5 boards each for the price of 1. There probably wasn't a need to do this as ordering it separately would have only costed like 2 dollars more but I always wanted to learn how to panelize and this seemed like a great opportunity for it.

I can fit like 4 boards (2 of each design) into one panel but I think ill use the rest of the space for a 3PDT switch breakout board which I'll make tommorow.



Overall I would say today was my most productive day, I've been working on this project since morning and basically redid everything today.


## Time Spent: 10 Hours


# Day 6 (7th June)

I decided to make a breakout board for the 3PDT footswitch as soldering wires directly to it gets messy after a while. I made the design in Easyeda because they had a footprint for the switch, then I imported it into KiCad.

My project was basically finished at this point. I added the breakout board into the panelized design and this was the result-

**Aw hell nah!** The panel actually ended up costing more, I guess jlcpcb doesn't like it when you cram 3 different designs onto a single board.

Well panelizing it was a waste of time but atleast I learned something new.

---

I spent about an hour or so updating my BOM and formatting everything in the project repo, the overall cost comes up to about $130 USD which is a bit more that I anticipated but hey atleast the pedal will look good this time.

# 23 June - Painting the enclosures

Most of my parts have arrived by now. I'm now waiting for my pinecil to arrive so I can solder the board (I broke my aliexpress iron).

I 3D printed a stencil as a guide for drilling holes in my enclosure (People usually print it out on paper and then use it but I don't have a regular printer so I decided to 3D print it), I drilled out 2 aluminium enclosures using my cordless Ikea drill and a step drill bit. This took a long time and created a lot of aluminum shavings in my room. 

I sanded down both the enclosures with a 150 grit sandpaper (that was the highest grid I had, ideally you should go with 600 or higher) and then spray painted them outside.

The black enclosure sort of got a wierd hammertone finish almost by complete accident and I like it a lot so I'm gonna keep it.
II tried cutting a tape stencil on the orange one but realized that the knife had actually cut the paint and left marks, so I decided to start over again. I resanded the enclosure, had to remove all the paint from it which was a long and tedious process, and then spray painted it again. This time I decided to leave it as is and not add a stencil.

# June 26 - DS-1

My pinecil arrived today and I soldered my DS-1 board. It DID NOT work.
I'll have to most likely start over again and this time check the outputs at every stage

# June 28 - Big Muff Assembly

I soldered up my big muff board today, I made sure to check its output at every stage before moving on, the final assembled board was outputting something on my oscilloscope which was a nice sign but it was really late at night so I did not actually test it.

# June 29 - Big Muff Testing

I tested out my big muff today and it WORKS! the sound is a bit choppy kind of, and cuts off if i close the enclosure, it sound a lot different than my old DS-1, and it kind of sounds muffed which makes sense cause its the big muff (duh).

Also I did a 1000iq move, so I actually messed up my 3PDT breakout board by making the pads too small to fit, well, I'm very smart so I ended up surface mounting the THT switch on it and well it works! 

*surface mounted tht*

# July 3 - DS-1 Troubleshooting

I tried soldering another DS-1 board and this time checking its output on every stage, and it turn out I used the wrong symbol/footprint for my transistor. 
It turns out not all transistors have the standard cbe layout some have a messed up bce layout which I had no idea even existed.

# July 5 - DS-1 Jank

So luckily I had a transistor kit and one of those transistors had a bce layout.
I accidentally soldered in my op amp the wrong way on the pcb and desoldering it was impossible so I had to start again.

After finally assembling everything properly this time I went on to test the pedal, to be honest it sounded pretty awful, it was very quiet and buzzy because of the swapped out transistors. At this point i just decided to order a new pcb with fixed footprint for the transistor.

## Time Spent: 5 Hours


# 19 July - DS-1 Works!

I got my new PCB and soldering everything together, I ran out of screw in terminals so I just soldered the wires directly on the PCB.

The DS-1 works now, but it kinda pops a lot which I'm assuming is probably because of a loose wire connection to the potentiometer.
