# DIY Distortion & Fuzz Pedal

## What am I making?
I'm making cheap DIY analog guitar effect pedals for Distortion and Fuzz. To ensure a high quality pedal I will be using reverse engineered schematic of the iconic Boss DS-1 and the Big Muff Pi. Careful planning will be done to ensure that these DIY pedals perform equally as well only for a fraction of the price, while still keeping in mind Mod-ability and ease of repair.

### My Goals For This Project-
- [ ] Only THT Components
- [ ] Easy to modify
- [ ] Cheap components

# Day 1 (17th May)

Since I already made a DS-1 pedal before I had experience with designing pedals and I also knew about stuff I should avoid adding in my design.
Some of those problems were -
- Having thin holes for the potentiometers
- Placing the potentiometer holes in the middle instead of at the edges
- Using holes to solder wire instead of having screw in terminals

To start with the project I made the DS-1 v2 schematics in kicad, the schematics for version 2 were similar to version one because the schematics just work!

I started out with PCB layout after finishing It. I always like to first start of with a rough layout to see how I can arrange my components and look at how I can improve from their and then restart the PCB layout again. 
This is exactly what I did for this design and by the end of the day I ended up with a layout that I liked.

The next step was routing everything together. Because I already made something like this I had experience and knew what to avoid while tracing. 
I carefully routed all the audio signals first, keeping the traces short and smooth. After that I routed my power traces, this time I made sure that the power traces were far away from the audio signal and that they also cross the audio traces are a 90 degree angle to reduce EMI and noise from the power trace radiating into the audio traces. This was a lesson I learned from making version 1, my power traces were routed improperly which introduced a 60hz hum from the cheap power supply into the audio signal, It worked fine but there was just a buzz which was a bit annoying.

This was the final result PCB design:

I was pretty locked in today!

# Day 2 (19th May)

I started working on designing the big muff pi schematic today. 

The big muff pi is pretty easy to make compared to a DS-1, and I finished making its schematics in like 30 mins.

After that I started working on the PCB for it. I again followed the same method I listed above of creating a rough layout then going to a finalized one. And this was the end result of the PCB.

# Day 3 (5th June)

tl;dr I was pretty ambitious when starting this project but I have now decided to split this into three different projects.

After pondering and doing some research I've decided to actually split this project. Right now Im making a lot of pedals and Initially I though all of them could be made using analog circuitry, but I was wrong, for a lot of these effects I listed initially (chorus, eq, loop, noise gate) having a digital pedal is the only viable option. And so I have decided I'm going to split this into three different projects- one of which is this project (Distortion, Fuzz , the second project would be making a digital pedal that's capable of the effects listed above and is expandable, lastly the third project would be create a pedalboard for these pedals and a dedicated low noise power supply. Creating a digital pedal is way more complicated that I initially expected it to be and that's why I'm gonna keep it as its own separate project. 



Now back to the actual project. Today I did some minor revisions over the DS-1 PCB layout, I added ground pours on both top and bottom layers and stitched them together with a lot of vias. This will help keep ground plane continuity throughout the board and reduce EMI which in turn will reduce any buzzing/hiss generated by a noisy power supply (hopefully).

I also realized just now that I placed in the screw in terminal footprints in the wrong orientation. 


I updated the footprints and fixed the problem.
