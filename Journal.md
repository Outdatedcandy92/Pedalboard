# DIY Pedalboard

## What am I making?
I'm making a fully DIY guitar pedal board. My plan is to design a set of pedals and then also design a board for it (pedal-board!).
The current plan is to have about 6 effects in total, a dedicated DC power supply for them, a custom designed board made using aluminium extrusions to house the pedals and and everything.

This is what I plan for my finished project to look like-
